# Coding Assistant - Two-Phase Workflow

## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

This coding workflow uses a **two-phase approach** for comprehensive and reliable implementations:

### **PHASE 1: DISCOVERY** 
- **File**: `cli_agents/prompts/discovery-prompt.md`
- **Purpose**: Analyze scope and create comprehensive file list
- **Output**: `outputs/affected-files.json`

### **PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION**
- **File**: `cli_agents/prompts/implementation-prompt.md` 
- **Purpose**: Implement changes using discovered file context
- **Input**: Uses file list from Phase 1

## WHEN TO USE EACH PHASE:

### Use Discovery Phase When:
- Starting a new implementation request
- Need to understand the scope of changes
- Want to identify all affected files before coding
- Planning complex changes with multiple dependencies

### Use Implementation Phase When:
- Discovery phase is complete
- `outputs/affected-files.json` exists
- Ready to make actual code changes
- Have comprehensive file context

## WORKFLOW COMMANDS:

### For Discovery (Phase 1):
```bash
# Use discovery prompt
cli --message-file cli_agents/prompts/discovery-prompt.md outputs/user-request.txt
```

### For Implementation (Phase 2):
```bash
# Use implementation prompt (after discovery)
cli --message-file cli_agents/prompts/implementation-prompt.md outputs/user-request.txt outputs/affected-files.json
```

## BENEFITS OF TWO-PHASE APPROACH:

‚úÖ **Complete Context**: All related files identified before implementation
‚úÖ **Reduced Errors**: No missing dependencies or incomplete changes  
‚úÖ **Better Planning**: Clear understanding of scope and complexity
‚úÖ **Systematic Implementation**: Structured approach to code changes
‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation

## LEGACY SINGLE-PHASE INSTRUCTIONS:

*The content below is kept for reference but the two-phase approach above is preferred.*

---

## INSTRUCTION #1: IMPLEMENT THE REQUESTED CHANGES AND PROVIDE SUMMARY

**IMPORTANT** YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL FILES WHICH ARE MANDATORY TO SOLVE THE USER REQUEST.

get /context of what must be changed and do /whole changes of files to reduce mistakes

**READ THE USER REQUEST FILE(`outputs/user-request.txt`)** to understand what code changes are needed. 

## MANDATORY TICKET REQUIREMENT:

**IMPORTANT**: Every implementation MUST be linked to a Jira ticket (DMC-XXX format).

1. **If ticket number is provided** in user request: Use it for branch and commit
2. **If NO ticket number provided**: You MUST ask the user to provide the DMC ticket number before proceeding
3. **Never proceed without a valid DMC-XXX ticket number**

Example: If user request doesn't include DMC-XXX, respond with:
"I need a DMC ticket number to proceed with this implementation. Please provide the ticket number (format: DMC-XXX) for this work."

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1) **IMPLEMENT CODE** - You are doing ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION, not just analysis
2) **MAKE REAL CHANGES** - Add files to chat context, I approve all of them. Modify, create, and update files as needed to fulfill the request
3) **WORK AUTONOMOUSLY** - Read any files you need, make changes without asking
4) **FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES** - Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code
5) **PROVIDE SUMMARY** - After implementation, provide a summary in the specified format
6) **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION** - Include all necessary files, tests, documentation as requested

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:

- **Read First**: Examine existing code structure, patterns, and conventions
- **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing codebase style and architecture
- **Quality Code**: Write production-ready code with proper error handling
- **Documentation**: Add comments and documentation where appropriate
- **Testing**: Include or update tests if specified in the request
- **Dependencies**: Add any necessary dependencies to appropriate files

## FINAL SUMMARY FORMAT:

Your final response must be wrapped to <RESPONSE> even it's success or not:

<RESPONSE>

</RESPONSE>

## GIT WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

After completing the implementation, you MUST create a feature branch and commit your changes using built-in commands following DMTools conventions:

1. **Create Feature Branch**: Use `/git checkout -b [prefix]/DMC-XXX` format
2. **Commit Changes**: Use `/commit "DMC-XXX - [ticket summary]\n[Short description of the change]"`

### Branch Naming Convention (DMTools Standard):
Based on sub-task prefix structure:

| Sub-task Prefix | Branch Format | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **[CORE]** | core/DMC-XXX | core/DMC-46 |
| **[API]** | api/DMC-XXX | api/DMC-46 |
| **[UI]** | ui/DMC-XXX | ui/DMC-46 |
| **[UI-COMP]** | ui-comp/DMC-XXX | ui-comp/DMC-46 |

### Commit Message Format (DMTools Standard):
```
DMC-XXX - [ticket summary]
[Short description of the change]
```

### Examples:

**UI Implementation:**
```
Branch: ui/DMC-46
Commit: DMC-46 - Add human-readable display names to job configurations
Updated job configuration forms to include displayName and description fields for better UX
```

**API Implementation:**
```
Branch: api/DMC-46
Commit: DMC-46 - Fix JSON deserialization errors in job configurations
Removed nested arrays from examples fields and updated validation logic
```

**Core Implementation:**
```
Branch: core/DMC-46
Commit: DMC-46 - Implement job configuration validation service
Added centralized validation logic for job configuration parameters
```

## QUALITY CHECKLIST (DMTools Standards):

Before completing implementation, verify:
- ‚úÖ Branch name follows prefix/DMC-XXX format
- ‚úÖ Commit message starts with DMC-XXX
- ‚úÖ Commit includes ticket summary
- ‚úÖ Commit has short description of changes
- ‚úÖ No trailing whitespace in commit message
- ‚úÖ Implementation follows DMTools coding standards

## WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

- The summary above will be extracted and included in the Pull Request description
- CLI tools will handle branch creation and commits automatically following DMTools standards
- The GitHub workflow will detect the new branch and create the PR
- Include any special deployment or setup instructions in the summary
- Link the created PR to the corresponding Jira ticket (DMC-XXX)

## COMPLETE WORKFLOW SEQUENCE:

You MUST follow this complete sequence for every implementation:

1. **Check what was modified**: `/run git status` to show what files were changed
2. **Create feature branch**: `/git checkout -b [prefix]/DMC-XXX` (use appropriate prefix: core, api, ui, ui-comp)
3. **Stage all changes**: `/run git add .` to add all modified files
4. **Create commit**: `/commit "DMC-XXX - [your implementation summary]\n[Short description of changes]"`
5. **Push changes**: `/run git push -u origin [prefix]/DMC-XXX`

These commands ensure comprehensive discovery and proper Git tracking following DMTools standards.

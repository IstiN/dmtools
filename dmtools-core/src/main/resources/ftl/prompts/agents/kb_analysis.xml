        <rules>
Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown code blocks or explanatory text.
Follow the exact JSON schema specified below.
Ensure all date fields use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
TEMPORARY IDs: Assign temporary IDs in format "q_1", "q_2", "a_1", "a_2", "n_1", "n_2" etc. The system will later auto-increment these to "q_0001", "q_0002", "a_0001", "a_0002" etc.
MAPPING Q→A: Use these temporary IDs to establish links. For example: question with id="q_1" can be answered by answer with id="a_1". Set answeredBy="a_1" in question and answersQuestion="q_1" in answer.
AREA: Required, ONE top-level category representing the broadest knowledge domain. This is the PRIMARY classification.
  BE SPECIFIC - choose the MOST RELEVANT domain based on what is ACTUALLY discussed, not the context:
  • "ai" or "machine-learning" - ONLY when discussing AI/ML technologies themselves (models, prompts, RAG, embeddings, training)
  • "platform" - platform features, APIs, integrations, system functionality
  • "collaboration" - meetings, chat features, team communication, channels
  • "infrastructure" - cloud, deployment, scalability, networking
  • "business" - billing, sales, licensing, pricing
  • "development" - coding, debugging, tools, frameworks
  • Other domains: "docker", "kubernetes", "python", "java", "security", "database", etc.
  
  IMPORTANT: Don't classify everything as "ai" just because it's an AI-related platform. Focus on WHAT is discussed, not WHERE.
TOPICS: Required at least 1. Array of 1(preferable)-3 specific themes or detailed subjects within the area. Use MAXIMUM SPECIFICITY with service/technology name (e.g., ["docker-build-optimization"], ["gemini-api-rate-limiting", "openai-api-error-handling"], ["kubernetes-ingress-configuration"]). Always include specific service/technology name when discussing APIs, databases, tools. These are SECONDARY classifications that provide more granular categorization. **IMPORTANT** avoid generic topics like "api-rate-limiting" (which API?), "database-optimization" (which DB?) - always be specific: "github-api-rate-limiting", "postgres-optimization".
TAGS: Array of related techniques, tools, specific concepts, or keywords mentioned (e.g., ["buildkit", "multi-stage", "layer-caching"]). These are TERTIARY metadata for search and cross-referencing.
Hierarchy: area (broadest) > topics (specific themes) > tags (granular keywords).
Quality scores for answers range from 0.0 to 1.0.
Links: **IMPORTANT** to find all links in the messages.
Extract actual author names from messages, normalize them consistently.

    <instructions>
Analyze the provided messages and extract all relevant knowledge structures.

IDENTIFY QUESTIONS: Direct questions asked by users. For each question:
  - Assign temporary ID: q_1, q_2, q_3 etc.
  - Set area: ONE top-level domain. Required. Choose based on WHAT is discussed:
    * "ai" - discussing AI/ML models, prompts, RAG, embeddings (e.g., "How to tune Claude-3 prompts?")
    * "platform" - platform APIs, integrations (e.g., "How to use DIAL API?")
    * "collaboration" - meetings, chats (e.g., "How to schedule team meetings?")
    * "infrastructure" - cloud, scalability (e.g., "How to deploy on Google Cloud?")
    * "business" - billing, pricing (e.g., "How does billing work?")
    * Other: "docker", "kubernetes", "python", etc.
  - Set topics: 1-2 detailed subjects (e.g., ["dockerfile-best-practices"]) - BE CONSERVATIVE, prefer 1 topic. Required at least 1.
    * Use MAXIMUM specificity: include service/technology name + domain + concept
    * Examples: "gemini-api-rate-limiting", "github-api-authentication", "docker-build-optimization", "postgres-connection-pooling"
    * NOT generic: avoid "api-rate-limiting" (which API?), "database-optimization" (which DB?), "error-handling" (where?)
    * BE SPECIFIC: "openai-api-error-handling", "kubernetes-ingress-configuration", "redis-cache-invalidation"
    * If discussing general concept without specific tech, use broader context: "rest-api-design", "microservices-architecture"
  - Set tags: specific keywords (e.g., ["buildkit", "multi-stage"])
  - Set answeredBy: temporary answer ID (e.g., "a_1") if answered, empty string otherwise

IDENTIFY ANSWERS: Solutions or responses. For each answer:
  - Assign temporary ID: a_1, a_2, a_3 etc.
  - Set area: ONE top-level domain (same as related question)
  - Set topics: 1-2 detailed subjects (can differ from question) - BE CONSERVATIVE, prefer 1 topic
    * Use MAXIMUM specificity (same as questions): "gemini-api-rate-limiting", "postgres-connection-pooling"
  - Set tags: specific keywords mentioned in the answer
  - Set answersQuestion: temporary question ID (e.g., "q_1") if it answers a question, empty string otherwise
  - Set quality: 0.0-1.0 based on completeness
  - **IMPORTANT**: If message has [Reply: ...] marker pointing to a question, treat it as an answer even if body is empty
  - For empty/brief replies, create descriptive text like "Response to [question topic]" and set quality: 0.3-0.5

IDENTIFY NOTES: Standalone facts or observations (not Q&A pairs):
  - Assign temporary ID: n_1, n_2, n_3 etc.
  - Set area/topics/tags same way as questions - BE CONSERVATIVE with topics count
    * Use MAXIMUM specificity (same as questions): "gemini-api-rate-limiting", "postgres-connection-pooling"

**IMPORTANT** **CRITICAL** Extract ALL LINKS from messages:
  - Links can appear inline in message text OR as standalone URLs on separate lines
  - Extract URLs even if they appear without surrounding text
  - Create meaningful titles from context: use card titles, nearby text, or URL content
  - If a message contains ONLY a URL with no context, extract it with a generic but descriptive title
  - DO NOT skip standalone URLs - they are just as important as inline links
  - Example formats to recognize:
    * Inline: "Check this article https://example.com about Docker"
    * Standalone: A message with just "https://example.com" on its own line
    * With card: A card title followed by a URL
  - You MUST extract every URL you see, regardless of format

Extract author names consistently throughout the analysis.

USE EXISTING CONTEXT: If existing people or topics are provided:
  - For author names: Use existing names when they match (normalize variations like "John" → "John Doe" if "John Doe" exists)
  - For topics: ALWAYS PREFER existing topic names when subject is similar or related (avoid synonyms like "docker-optimization" if "build-optimization" exists, avoid "performance-tuning" if "optimization" exists)
  - Create NEW topics ONLY if the subject is clearly different and doesn't fit existing ones
  - This prevents duplicates and maintains consistency across incremental updates

CRITICAL FOR Q→A MAPPING: When a message thread shows a question followed by a solution, establish the link using temporary IDs:
  - Question: id="q_1", answeredBy="a_1"
  - Answer: id="a_1", answersQuestion="q_1"
The system will later auto-increment these to q_0001, q_0002, a_0001, a_0002 and preserve the relationships.

**IMPORTANT** RECOGNIZE REPLY INDICATORS:
  - Messages with "[Reply: ...]" in attachments or body are responses to previous messages
  - If a message has "Reply:" marker referencing a question, treat it as an answer even if body is empty or brief
  - Pattern: "[Reply: question text...]" followed by response = this is an answer to that question
  - Even short responses ("yes", "agree", "+1") with Reply marker can be answers if they provide value

HIERARCHY:
  - AREA: Top-level domain - what is ACTUALLY discussed:
    * "ai" - AI/ML tech (models, prompts, RAG)
    * "platform" - platform features, APIs
    * "collaboration" - meetings, chats
    * "infrastructure" - cloud, deployment
    * "business" - billing, sales
    * Others: "docker", "kubernetes", "python", etc.
  - TOPICS: MAXIMUM SPECIFICITY with service/tech name (e.g., ["docker-build-optimization"], ["gemini-api-rate-limiting"], ["teams-meeting-scheduling"])
  - TAGS: Specific keywords (e.g., ["buildkit", "multi-stage", "caching"])

For expertise signals: high-quality answers should have quality scores closer to 1.0.

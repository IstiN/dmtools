    <instructions>
        Create detailed content for a presentation on the topic "${global.topic}" for an audience of "${global.audience}".

        User Request:
        ${global.userRequest}

        Additional Data:
        ${global.additionalData}

        Important Guidelines:
        1. Create slides that fully address the user's request
        2. Only use information that is explicitly provided in the user request or additional data
        3. Do NOT invent or fabricate data that isn't present in the inputs
        4. If specific statistics or facts are mentioned in the additional data, use them exactly as provided
        5. Create an appropriate number of slides to cover all required information thoroughly
        6. Ensure the presentation has a logical flow with introduction, main content, and conclusion

        For each slide, provide:
        1. A clear title
        2. Detailed content that would appear on the slide
        3. Any data that should be visualized (tables, charts) - use ONLY data provided in the inputs
        4. Notes about what type of slide would be best (content, table, chart, image)

        Return your response as a JSON array where each object represents a slide with these properties:
        - title: The slide title
        - content: The main content for the slide (DO NOT duplicate this key in any slide object)
        - slideType: Suggested slide type (content, table, bar-chart, pie-chart, image)
        - data: Any structured data for charts or tables (if applicable)
        - notes: Additional context or presenter notes
        - call to actions: try to define call to actions based on the data, no water or generic actions but proved by data.
        - each slide must bring value to reader, no generic slides.
    </instructions>
    <formatting>
        <rules>
            Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no additional text.
            Make sure the content is detailed enough to create meaningful slides.
            For data visualizations, use ONLY data explicitly provided in the inputs.
            Do NOT invent statistics or facts not present in the provided information.
            Ensure variety in slide types for an engaging presentation.
            Properly escape all special characters in JSON strings: use \" for quotes, \\ for backslashes, \n for newlines, \t for tabs, etc.
            For content slides with markdown, place the markdown content in the 'content' field only, not in separate fields.
            Ensure all JSON is properly formatted and valid - test your JSON structure before finalizing.
            If a slide needs both descriptive text and formatted content, combine them in a single 'content' field using markdown.
            All content in slide must bring value to reader. Don't duplicate content in different sections.
            Subtitles, Descriptions can be skipped if it duplicates Content.

        Rules:
        1. Analyze the issue types JSON to extract all issue types with their properties
        2. Analyze the fields JSON to extract all fields (including custom fields) relevant for agent understanding
        3. Structure the output to include issue types and fields information
        4. Return only valid JSON format without any additional text or formatting

    <input_data>
        <project_key>
            ${global.projectKey}
        </project_key>
        <issue_types>
            ${global.issueTypesJson}
        </issue_types>
        <fields>
            ${global.fieldsJson}
        </fields>
    </input_data>
    <formatting>
        <rules>
            Return results as a JSON object with the following structure:
            {
                "issueTypes": [array of issue type objects with name, id, and other properties],
                "fields": {object containing field information}
            }
            The output must be in plain JSON format without any additional text, formatting, or markdown.
            Don't use ```, json markdowns.

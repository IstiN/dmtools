        Your task is to analyze completed tickets to understand workflow patterns, transitions, and how tickets move through workflows to completion.
        
        Rules:
        1. Analyze the completed tickets data to identify patterns in workflow transitions
        2. Identify common paths tickets take to reach final statuses
        3. Note any patterns in status transitions
        4. Provide a summary of workflow analysis including identified final statuses
        5. Return only valid JSON format without any additional text or formatting
    </instructions>
    <input_data>
        <project_key>
            ${global.projectKey}
        </project_key>
        <final_statuses>
            ${global.finalStatuses}
        </final_statuses>
        <completed_tickets_data>
            ${global.completedTicketsData}
        </completed_tickets_data>
    </input_data>
    <formatting>
        <rules>
            Return results as a JSON object with the following structure:
            {
                "summary": "Summary of workflow analysis",
                "finalStatuses": [array of final status names],
                "commonTransitions": [array of common transition patterns],
                "patterns": "Description of identified patterns"
            }
            The output must be in plain JSON format without any additional text, formatting, or markdown.
            Don't use ```, json markdowns.

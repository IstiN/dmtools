        It's important to recognize 1-2 keywords (IDEAL only 1 word) which best describe the core task in the request, and these must be first.
        Focus strictly on the core task mentioned in the user request, ignoring any project-specific details or broader context.
        Do not include project names, company names, or specific project identifiers in the keywords.
        Generate keywords that would be useful for searching about the task in general, not just in the specific context provided.

        <example>
            <human>Generate keywords for "The impact of artificial intelligence on modern healthcare"</human>
            <ai>["healthcare", "AI healthcare", "medical AI", "healthcare innovation", "AI diagnosis", "AI treatment", "healthcare technology", "AI medical research", "patient care AI", "AI health solutions", "medical automation"]</ai>
        </example>
        <example>
            <human>Generate keywords for "Best practices for sustainable urban planning"</human>
            <ai>["urban", "sustainable urbanism", "green cities", "eco-friendly planning", "urban sustainability", "smart growth", "sustainable development", "urban ecology", "green infrastructure", "sustainable transportation", "urban resilience"]</ai>
        </example>
        <example>
            <human>Generate keywords for "Implement a machine learning model for predictive maintenance in the XYZ Corporation's manufacturing process"</human>
            <ai>[INCORRECT RESPONSE: "XYZ Corporation", "manufacturing process", "machine learning", "predictive maintenance", "implementation", "corporate ML", "industrial AI", "XYZ manufacturing", "process optimization", "ML model"]</ai>
            <explanation>This response incorrectly includes the company name "XYZ Corporation" and uses overly broad terms like "machine learning" and "implementation". It also includes project-specific details like "manufacturing process" instead of focusing solely on the core task of predictive maintenance.</explanation>

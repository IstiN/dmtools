You are a highly skilled software testing engineer specializing in designing tests.
Check if the {new story} is related to the already created {existing test cases}.

IMPORTANT Rules:
1. Consider partial relationships as well; even if the relationship is not direct but somewhat connected, add the key to response.
2. Your response must be JSON Array of keys of test case if it's related to the story, otherwise empty array.

{new story}
<#assign issue = ticket>
<#include "issue_title_description.md">
<#list extraTickets as issue>
${(issue.ticketKey)!""}
<#include "issue_title_description.md">
</#list>
{new story}

{existing test cases}
<#list testCases as testCase>
${testCase.ticketKey} ${testCase.ticketTitle}
</#list>
{existing test cases}

Your answer must be JSONArray only (Maximum 20 keys) with keys. Do not include ticket title in json array response, do not wrap it in ```. Example of AI response: [KEY-1, KEY-2]. Don't skip proejct code. Don't use ```, html markdowns.

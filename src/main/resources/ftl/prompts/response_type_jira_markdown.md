Write a detailed response that will be used as a JIRA ticket description. The response should adhere to the following JIRA markdown formatting rules:

Headings: Start the line with "h1." for the main heading, "h2." for subheadings, and so forth up to "h6." for the smallest heading.
Bold Text: Enclose the text in asterisks (*) to make it bold. For example, *bold*.
Italic Text: Enclose the text in underscores (_) to make it italic. For example, _italic_.
Unordered Lists: Start each line with an asterisk and a space (* ) for bullet points.
Ordered Lists: Start each line with a number followed by a period and a space (1. ) for numbered items.
Links: Use square brackets for the link text followed by the URL in parentheses. For example, [Google](http://www.google.com).
Code Blocks: Enclose inline code with curly braces and the percent symbol ({%code%}), and use {code} before and after a block of code to format it as a code block.
Quotes: Start the line with bq. to create a blockquote.

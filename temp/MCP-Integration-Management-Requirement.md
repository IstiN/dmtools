# Integration: MCP Integration Management System

## Mandatory Cross-References
**Epic:** [Link to parent epic - e.g., DMT-XXX Integration Platform Enhancement]
**Feature Area:** Integration
**Priority:** High
**Owner:** Business Analyst

---

## Business Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoints provide global access without user authentication
- No user-specific integration scoping exists
- Users cannot manage their personal MCP configurations
- Integration access is not personalized or secured per user

**Impact:**
- Security risk due to uncontrolled access to integrations
- Poor user experience with no personalized integration management
- Lack of traceability for integration usage
- No ability for users to customize their integration toolkit

## Business Requirements

### BR-1: MCP Configuration Management
**As a** DMTools user  
**I want to** create and manage personalized MCP configurations  
**So that** I can have secure, customized access to my relevant integrations  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can create named MCP configurations
- User can select specific integrations for each MCP (checkbox selection)
- User can view list of all their created MCPs with names and associated integrations
- User can delete existing MCP configurations via 3-dots menu
- MVP scope includes Jira and Confluence integrations only

### BR-2: MCP Access Code Generation
**As a** DMTools user  
**I want to** easily obtain configuration code for external tools  
**So that** I can quickly set up MCP access in development environments like Cursor  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generated code follows standard MCP configuration format
- Code includes proper endpoint URLs with user-specific tokens
- Code is easily copyable with one-click functionality
- Generated configuration is immediately usable without manual editing

**Example Expected Output:**
```json
"aiagency": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://dmtools-431977789017.us-central1.run.app/mcp/id/[user-specific-token]"
  ]
}
```

### BR-3: Mobile App Integration
**As a** DMTools mobile user  
**I want to** access MCP management through the Flutter app  
**So that** I can manage my integrations on any device  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- MCP management accessible via left navigation menu
- Responsive design works on mobile devices
- Create button prominently displayed in header
- Intuitive UI for managing multiple MCP configurations

### BR-4: RESTful API Management
**As a** system administrator or power user  
**I want to** programmatically manage MCP configurations via REST API  
**So that** I can automate MCP setup and integrate with other systems  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Full CRUD operations available via REST API
- API endpoints documented in Swagger UI
- Proper authentication and authorization for API access
- API responses include all necessary configuration data

## Business Value Proposition

### Primary Benefits:
1. **Enhanced Security:** User-specific authentication and integration scoping
2. **Improved User Experience:** Personalized integration management
3. **Developer Productivity:** Easy setup for development tools
4. **Scalability:** Foundation for expanding integration ecosystem

### Success Metrics:
- User adoption rate of MCP configurations
- Reduction in integration setup time
- User satisfaction scores for integration management
- API usage metrics for programmatic access

## User Journey Flow

1. **Discovery:** User opens DMTools Flutter app and sees MCP menu item
2. **Overview:** User views list of existing MCP configurations (name + integrations)
3. **Creation:** User clicks "Create MCP" → provides name → selects integrations via checkboxes
4. **Configuration:** User opens created MCP → views generated configuration code
5. **Implementation:** User copies code for use in external tools (e.g., Cursor)
6. **Management:** User can delete configurations via 3-dots menu when no longer needed

---

## Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions:**
- Users have valid DMTools accounts with integration permissions
- External tools support standard MCP configuration format
- MVP focuses on Jira and Confluence only

**Dependencies:**
- User authentication system
- Integration permission management
- MCP protocol implementation
- Flutter app infrastructure

---

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Advanced integration configuration options
- Integration beyond Jira and Confluence
- Shared MCP configurations between users
- Integration usage analytics and monitoring
- Bulk import/export of MCP configurations

---

## Questions Requiring Clarification

**[Q] Security Model:** How should MCP tokens be scoped - per user, per MCP, or per integration?  
**[Q] Token Lifecycle:** What should be the expiration policy for generated MCP tokens?  
**[Q] Integration Limits:** Should there be a limit on number of MCPs per user or integrations per MCP?

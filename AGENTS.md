Use MCP Tools - Remember that you have a rich set of MCP tools and use them.
**MANDATORY: Use Serena MCP for all code analysis and editing operations** to achieve maximum token efficiency and precision.
Serena MCP provides symbol-level analysis and editing capabilities that drastically reduce token consumption compared to reading entire files.
Before reading any code file, use `get_symbols_overview` to understand structure, then `find_symbol` with targeted queries to read only necessary code sections. Use `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_after_symbol`, and `insert_before_symbol` for precise modifications instead of broad file rewrites. This approach can reduce token usage by 70-90% while improving accuracy and maintaining architectural compliance. Token economy is critical for complex projects - every unnecessary token spent on redundant file reads limits our ability to perform deep analysis and implement comprehensive solutions. NOTE: before using any serena tool you MUST activate it first with `serena_activate_project`.

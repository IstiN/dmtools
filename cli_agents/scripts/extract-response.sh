# CLI Tool Execution Error

**Status**: CLI execution failed with exit code $EXIT_CODE

**Issue**: This appears to be a crash in the CLI tool, possibly related to command usage or model limitations.

**Recommendation**:
- Check the execution logs for specific error details
- Review the user request for problematic commands
- Consider simplifying the request or breaking it into smaller tasks

**Next Steps**:
- Check if any files were modified despite the crash
- Manual implementation may be required if CLI cannot handle this request

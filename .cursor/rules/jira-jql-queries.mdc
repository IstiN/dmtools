# Essential JQL Queries for Project Management

## Requirements Management Queries

### Approved Requirements Without Stories
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Requirement AND status = Approved 
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("is related to")
```

### Requirements With Open Questions  
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Requirement 
AND issueFunction in hasLinks("is blocked by") 
AND issueFunction in linkedIssuesOf("issuetype = Question AND status not in (Answered, Closed)")
```

### Requirements by Feature Area
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Requirement 
AND "Feature Area" = "User Authentication" 
ORDER BY status, priority DESC
```

## Development Tracking Queries

### All Stories by Type for Current Sprint
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND sprint in openSprints() 
ORDER BY summary
```

### Unlinked Stories (Missing Requirements)
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("relates to")
```

### Stories Ready for Development
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND status = "Ready for Dev" 
AND issueFunction in hasLinks("relates to")
ORDER BY priority DESC
```

### Core Stories Without API/UI Implementation
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = "Core Story" AND status = Done
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("is related to")
```

## Quality Assurance Queries

### Stories Without Test Cases
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND status = Done 
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("is tested by")
```

### Production Bugs Last 30 Days
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Bug 
AND "Environment Found" = Production 
AND created >= -30d 
ORDER BY priority DESC
```

### Failed QA Issues
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND status = "Failed QA" 
ORDER BY updated DESC
```

### Test Cases Without Automation
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = "Test Case" 
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("is automated by")
AND priority in (High, Critical)
```

## Feature Area Analysis

### Complete Feature View  
```jql
project = DMT AND "Epic Link" = EPIC-123 
ORDER BY "Feature Area", issuetype, status
```

### Feature Area Progress
```jql
project = DMT AND "Feature Area" = "User Authentication" 
AND issuetype in (Requirement, "Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story")
ORDER BY status, issuetype
```

### Cross-Feature Dependencies
```jql
project = DMT AND issueFunction in hasLinks("blocks", "is blocked by")
AND "Feature Area" != null
ORDER BY "Feature Area"
```

## Workflow & Process Queries

### Open Questions by Priority
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Question 
AND status not in (Answered, Closed) 
ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC
```

### Blocked Work Items
```jql
project = DMT AND status not in (Done, Closed) 
AND issueFunction in hasLinks("is blocked by")
ORDER BY priority DESC
```

### Items in Code Review Too Long
```jql
project = DMT AND status = "Code Review" 
AND statusCategoryChangedDate <= -3d
ORDER BY statusCategoryChangedDate ASC
```

## Cross-Reference Validation Queries

### Stories Missing Epic Links
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND "Epic Link" is EMPTY
```

### Bugs Missing Story References
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Bug 
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("relates to")
AND status not in (Closed, "Won't Fix")
```

### Questions Without Epic Context
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Question 
AND "Epic Link" is EMPTY 
AND status not in (Answered, Closed)
```

## Dashboard Queries

### Sprint Health Check
```jql
project = DMT AND sprint in openSprints() 
AND issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND status not in (Done, "Code Review")
ORDER BY priority DESC, status
```

### Weekly Bug Report
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = Bug 
AND created >= -7d 
ORDER BY "Environment Found", priority DESC
```

### Architecture Review Items
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = "Architecture Design" 
AND status in ("In Review", "Draft") 
ORDER BY "Feature Area", created ASC
```

## Automation & Reporting

### Test Automation Coverage
```jql
project = DMT AND issuetype = "Test Case" 
AND "Feature Area" is not EMPTY
ORDER BY "Feature Area", priority DESC
```

### Feature Completion Status
```jql
project = DMT AND "Epic Link" in (EPIC-123) 
AND issuetype in (Requirement, "Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story")
ORDER BY issuetype, status
```

## Quick Filters for Boards

### Core Stories Filter
```jql
summary ~ "^\\[CORE\\]"
```

### API Stories Filter  
```jql
summary ~ "^\\[API\\]"
```

### UI Stories Filter
```jql
summary ~ "^\\[UI\\]"
```

### Production Bugs Filter
```jql
issuetype = Bug AND "Environment Found" = Production
```

### Open Questions Filter
```jql
issuetype = Question AND status != Closed
```

### Missing Cross-References Filter
```jql
issuetype in ("Core Story", "API Story", "UI Story") 
AND issueFunction not in hasLinks("relates to")
```

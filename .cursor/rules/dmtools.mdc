The application is gradle based. You can't create any POM files and dependencies there. 
It's java server / jar app, you can't run any python nodjs logic here.
When we introduce new component in html pages first the component must be added to styleguide if it doens't exist. If it exists we must use it.


For any new page:
Import styleguide.css first (for components)
Import styles.css second (for layouts)
Use component classes from styleguide, if there is no component create new components first there
Add layout classes as needed
No more duplicates! ðŸŽ‰ The design system is now the single source of truth for all UI components.

Use "./gradlew " compile for files what you're changing command if you change any java code and run unitTests of what was changed to be sure that code is compiling and working.

If you need to create new API endpoint you must create specification in OpenApi as well.


Use 'prototype' folder for any prototyping work.
Use 'temp' folder for any temporary scripts

NEVER Commit TOKENS to Repository or write to files which are committed to repository.

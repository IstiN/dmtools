# Aider Analysis Assistant Instructions

## INSTRUCTION #1: WRITE YOUR RESPONSE TO THE FILE
**IMMEDIATELY write your complete analysis to "aider-outputs/analysis-response.md"**
This file already exists and is waiting for your response. Fill it with your analysis.

You have access to these files:
1. **This file** (`aider/assist-prompt.md`) - Contains your instructions 
2. **User request file** (`aider-outputs/user-request.txt`) - Contains the specific request to analyze
3. **Response file** (`aider-outputs/analysis-response.md`) - **WRITE YOUR RESPONSE HERE**

**READ THE USER REQUEST FILE** to understand what analysis is needed, then **WRITE YOUR RESPONSE TO analysis-response.md**.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1) **WRITE TO analysis-response.md** - Put your complete analysis in "aider-outputs/analysis-response.md" 
2) **DO NOT IMPLEMENT CODE** - You are doing ANALYSIS and DOCUMENTATION only, NOT implementation 
3) **DO NOT MODIFY EXISTING FILES** - Do not change any .java, .yml, .json, or other existing files except analysis-response.md
4) **READ-ONLY MODE** - Only read existing files to understand the codebase
5) **ANALYSIS ONLY** - Write a solution design document, not actual code changes
6) **WORK AUTONOMOUSLY** - Read any files you need for analysis without asking
7) **MARKDOWN FORMAT** - Your response must be in valid markdown with diagrams if needed
8) **FOLLOW TEMPLATE** - Use the exact response format template from the user request
9) **FILL THE FILE** - The analysis-response.md file is empty and waiting for your content

## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

- **Read First**: Examine existing code, APIs, models, services, and configurations
- **Design Only**: Provide recommendations, answers based on codebase, not implementation, not creativity
- **Template Compliance**: Follow any specific format templates mentioned in the user request
- **Comprehensive**: Include all necessary diagrams, endpoints, and design decisions
- **No Code Changes**: Your role is to analyze and design, not to implement

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

- Create `aider-outputs/analysis-response.md` with your complete analysis
- Use markdown format for all content
- Include Mermaid diagrams where appropriate with valid mermaid syntax
- Follow any specific templates mentioned in the user request

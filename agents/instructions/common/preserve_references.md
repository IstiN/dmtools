**IMPORTANT** You must keep exact syntax and references to attachments if there are any in description of the ticket. Especially if we need it in future. If you remove reference from description we lose attachments. For instance, if initial description has !image-20250923-195553.png|width=763,alt="image-20250923-195553.png"!, it must be presented in new description as well.

**IMPORTANT** You must keep ALL links and references from initial description logically inserted to output description. Otherwise you lose it. You can add section like: References [Link]

**IMPORTANT** if current description looks fully correct look any mentions of tagging account like [~accountid:712020:39ae9870-8a56-44be-945e-a8ad26273932], which means user asked extra improvements. That can be in comments or in the texts.
